# Monty Hall Problem Solver
As it says on the tin, this is a very simple console program that simulates the Monty Hall problem.

![The Monty Hall problem is defined as follows: Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?](/screenshot.png?raw=true)
